# ðŸŽ¾ Tennis0

AI-powered tennis game where you play against different LLM models through Vercel AI Gateway.

## Features

- Play tennis against 25+ different AI models
- Real-time AI decision making with strategic reasoning
- Beautiful tennis court graphics with realistic physics
- Mobile and desktop support
- Model selection from various providers (OpenAI, Meta, Google, Mistral, etc.)

## Setup

1. Get your AI Gateway API key from [Vercel AI Gateway](https://vercel.com/ai-gateway)

2. Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:
```bash
AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY=your_ai_gateway_api_key_here
```

3. Install dependencies and run:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to play

## How to Play

- **Desktop**: Move your mouse to control the paddle
- **Mobile**: Touch and drag to move your paddle
- First to 5 points wins!
- Choose different AI models to experience different playing styles

    I --> J[Check Collisions]
    J --> K{Point Scored?}
    K -->|Yes| L[Reset Ball Position]
    K -->|No| B
    L --> B

    M[Canvas Rendering] --> N[Draw Court]
    N --> O[Draw Paddles]
    O --> P[Draw Ball]
    P --> Q[Draw Scores]

    B --> M
```

### Game Architecture Flow

1. **Player Input**: Mouse/touch movements control the player's paddle
2. **Game Physics**: Ball movement, collisions, and trajectory calculations
3. **AI Decision Making**: When needed, API calls to LLM models for paddle positioning
4. **State Management**: Game state updates with scores, positions, and game status
5. **Visual Rendering**: Real-time canvas drawing of the tennis court and elements

## AI Models Available

The game uses Vercel AI Gateway to access models from:
- **OpenAI**: GPT-4o Mini, GPT-5 Nano, GPT-4.1 Nano
- **Meta**: Llama 3.3 70B, Llama 4 Scout, Llama 4 Maverick  
- **Google**: Gemini 2.0 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite
- **Mistral**: Ministral 3B/8B, Codestral, Devstral Small
- **Amazon**: Nova Micro, Nova Lite
- **Alibaba**: Qwen 3 14B/30B/32B
- **DeepSeek**: DeepSeek V3
- **xAI**: Grok 3 Mini
- **Cohere**: Command R

Each model has its own playing personality and strategy!
